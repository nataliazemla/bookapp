# üåç Compose Multiplatform Learning Project

This repository is my personal Compose Multiplatform learning project. The goal is to deeply understand how to architect and develop shared code across Android, iOS, and potentially desktop/web platforms using **Compose Multiplatform**.

> üìå This project follows the structure and guidance from **Philipp Lackner‚Äôs Compose Multiplatform YouTube course**. I plan to extended, customized, and annotated the code as part of my **hands-on learning experience**.


## üìö Goals

- Learn **Compose Multiplatform** for building reactive UI across Android and Desktop
- Explore core libraries and patterns used in real-world apps:
  - **Koin** for dependency injection
  - **Room** for local persistence on Android
  - **Ktor** and **OkHttp** for networking
  - **Kotlinx Serialization** for data parsing
- Understand clean architecture layering within a Compose MP context
